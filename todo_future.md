# Quake II RTXPerimental Contenting Todo Features:
## Features most certain to be on a future Todo List:
* Client Game:
	* Custom ``user input`` code/commands.
	* Code ``client-side`` specific effects.
	* Proper control over **HUD**.
* Shared Game:
	* PMove being extracted to Shared Game allows for customization of player movement.

## Possible contending ideas:
* Allow for entity class type specific read/write entity ``net code``?
* Collision code rewrite. (Use proper **matrix/quaternions**, and allow for different ``hull`` types such as ``Spheres``, ``Cylinders`` and ``Capsules``.)
	* This requires several editing/rewriting parts of the game **Physics** as well.
* Proper control over ``IQM's`` Skeletal Animation capabilities.
* Add in [RmlUI](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi) and replace the HUD and menus with it. (And possibly, allow in-game menus as well.)
